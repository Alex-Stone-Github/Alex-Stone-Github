# Dotfiles

## Intro & Install

Hello, these are my configuration files("dotfiles"). I am structuring this
project to make it easy to install on a standard unix system with a
configuration directory. To install these dotfiles run the following commands:

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the respository
3. Run the installer: `make install`

_All of the dependencies should be pretty self explanetory: make, git, and neovim + basics..._


## Neovim

In order to get vim up and running. Do the following
Run inside nvim:
    - CocInstall

## Fonts & Icons

I use proto nerd font. It is bundled into this install script.

## Alacritty

I use alacritty. This installs the configuration for alacritty.


# Sample

There is also a sample c file to test editor settings on, upon a successful
install.
