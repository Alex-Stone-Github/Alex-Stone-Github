# Hello,

## About Me
I am Alex Stone, I am 15 years old, and I like to code. Here I think is a easy place for me to put some of the projects that I am working on I feel would be beneficial to share with the world. 

## Interest
I do not like to give out to much information, but I do have a lot of interest in computers. Here are some of the things I am interested in that relate back to computers:

- Machine Learning
- Low Level Computer Systems
- Operating System Devlopment
- Game Development
- And Really just anything to do with computers...

## Please Excuse my Ignorance
I ask that you forgive me of all the ignorance, I am literally just learning about Geometry in school and have never taken a class in computer science; Everything I know is completely self taught. I am always learning just like everybody else and do not know everything.
