# Hello

I am Alex, a computer and technology enthusiast. I am based out of the United
States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York.

## Cool Things

If you have a cool project to work on, let me know. I can help you out!

## My Settings

If you would like to install many of many settings, configurations, and macros,
checkout `/DOTFILES.md`. It should be as simple as running `make install`. I
typically pair these settings with a vanilla gnome setup.
